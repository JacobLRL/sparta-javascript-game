## Rules:
You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.

## Controls:
left-click: clear the square if it is not flagged  
right-click: flag square  
double-click: clear surrounding square if the number of flags equals the number on the square

## Modes:
Easy Mode: 8x8 grid with 10 mines  
Intermediate Mode: 16x16 grid with 40 mines  
Hard Mode: 30x16 grid with 99 mines  
Learning Mode: Mouse changes from default cursor to pointer when hovering over a bomb

## Design:
Top left is the number of bombs left after flagging  
Top right is the timer  
The "Smiley face" in the top middle is the reset button

## Information:
This game was created in 5 days as part of Sparta's javascript games week, where I put my javascript knowledge to the test by building one of my favourite, addicting games Minesweeper, looks best in Google Chrome.
